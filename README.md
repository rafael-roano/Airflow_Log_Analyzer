# Mini Project - Airflow Log Analyzer

This is the implementation of a Log Analyzer using Airflow. This project builds over the previous mini project "DAG Scheduling on Airflow", and it consists of a DAG that includes a Python method to analyze the log files generated by DAG "marketvol2".

## Description

The Log Analyzer goes over all the log files generated by DAG "marketvol2" runs, which are saved on the Airflow default logs subdirectory and performs the following:

* Detect all the error lines in the different log files
* Count error lines
* Record error lines on a list
* Print error counted and error lines from list

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

* Have implemented previous mini project "DAG Scheduling on Airflow"[1]

**Usage**

1. Download log_analyzer_dag.py
2. Save log_analyzer_dag.py on dags folder
3. Schedule log_analyzer_dag.py

Log Analyzer can also be tested by directly running file log_analyzer.py on the running container:

1. Download log_analyzer.py from github "alternative_version" folder
2. Save file on dags folder
3. Connect to Docker container and run log_analyzer.py file (inside dags folder)
